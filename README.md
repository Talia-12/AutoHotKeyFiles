# AutoHotKey Files

This is a set of files containing all the scripts I've made for managing my hotkeys, including hotkeys triggered by my mouse. Files starting with Functions are providing functions that are used by other files.

Autoclicker provides a basic autoclicker, both left and right mouse button options.
Autoscroller starts the screen scrolling at a steady pace.
ChromeTabSaver provides hotkeys to save the addresses of open chromium tabs to a .txt file, and load them back again.
General contains hotkeys that didn't fit anywhere else.
Helper pops up a window explaining what hotkeys the other files provide.
Monitor provides hotkeys for turning off/locking the display.
MouseBindings provides functionality for  Razer Naga 1-12 buttons.

- the actual keybindings for MouseBindings are generated by generate_MouseBindings.py using the instructions stored in MouseBindingsSettings.json.

OpeningPrograms is hotkeys for opening programs.
